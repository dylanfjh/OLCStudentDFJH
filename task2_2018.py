'''
The following program allows the weights of 15 bags of rice to be input. 
The correct weight for each bag of rice must be 
between 4.9 kg and 5.1 kg inclusive.
'''
# bags_rice = 15
# upper_bound = 5.1
# lower_bound = 4.9
# for count in range(bags_rice):
#     bag_weight = float(input("Enter the weight of the bag of rice "))
#     if bag_weight > upper_bound:
#         print("The bag of rice is overweight")
#     if bag_weight < lower_bound:
#         print("The bag of rice is underweight")

Open the file RICEBAGS.py
Save the file as MYBAGS_<your name>_<center number>_<index number>.py

1.	Edit the program so that it:
a.	Accepts the weights for only 10 bags of rice.

'''
# bags_rice = 10
# upper_bound = 5.1
# lower_bound = 4.9

#         print("The bag of rice is overweight")
#     if bag_weight < lower_bound:
#         print("The bag of rice is underweight")

b.	Prints out the message “The bag of rice is the correct weight” 
when a weight entered is between 4.9kg and 5.1 kg inclusive.

c.	Prints out the number of bags of rice that were underweight, 
as well as the number that were overweight, after the weights of 
all the bags have been entered.
