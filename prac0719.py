# Q3: Convert From Lowercase to Uppercase and Vice Versa
# Design a program to ask user to create a username. 
# Check all the characters in the username. If the character is in uppercase, 
# convert it to lowercase and vice versa. Display the new username after conversion.

# Test case 1:

# Create an username: WhyWantToBeBotak
# Your new username is wHYwANTtObEbOTAK

# .upper()    .lower()   ## change to upper or lower
# .isupper()    .islower()   # check whether upper or lower
# # how to check each character in a string??? for loop to

# name = "dylan"
# print(name.upper())

# print("A".isupper())

def word():
    

# word = "WhyWantToBeBotak"
# # to insert the letters in. if add number then num = ""/[]
# username = "" 
# # loop through every single character in this string
# for i in word:
#     if i.isupper():
#         username = username + i.lower()
#     else:
#         username = username + i.upper()
# print(username)
